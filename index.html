            There's not much to tell, i like to play games mostly these days. Typically of the video variety
            but occasionally the analogue sort as well. These days i play a lot of League of Legends with my
            friends whenever I have the opportunity. I'm pretty easy-going for the most part, though I have been
            told I'm pretty stubborn. I'm not sure if I'd disagree, but i do certainly like to be acknowledged.
            Although I've been told I'm smart, i tend to realize that there's a lot that i don't know about the
            things that i like, particularly programming these days. My humor is pretty all over the place as well,
            i have a lot of the typical sort of shit-posting humor one might expect from someone my age,
            I'm 21 by the way, but i also have a fair amount of pun affinity and classic humor from my dad.
